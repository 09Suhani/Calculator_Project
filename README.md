BASIC CALCULATOR:
A simple, web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator performs essential arithmetic operations, follows the BODMAS rule, and includes additional features like memory storage, square root calculation, and error handling. The layout is mobile-friendly, allowing for smooth operation across devices.

FEATURES:
-> Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-> BODMAS Rule: Calculates expressions based on the correct order of operations.
-> Clear and Equal Functions: Allows users to clear the display or get the final result.
-> Square Root Calculation: Computes the square root of a given number.
-> Division by Zero Error Handling: Prevents mathematical errors by showing "Error" when dividing by zero.
-> Memory Functions:

1.  Memory Add (M+): Adds the current display value to memory.
2.  Memory Subtract (M-): Subtracts the current display value from memory.
3.  Memory Recall (MR): Displays the stored memory value.
4.  Memory Clear (MC): Clears the memory.

INSTALLATION:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser to start using the calculator.

HOW TO USE ?

- Basic Operations:

1. Enter numbers and operators using either the buttons or keyboard.

2. Press "=" to evaluate the current expression.
   Example: Enter 8 + 2 and press "=", the display will show 10.

- Clear:
  -> Press "Clear" to clear the entire expression and start a new calculation.

- Square Root Calculation (√):
  -> Press "√" to compute the square root of the current value.
  Example: If 16 is displayed, pressing "√" will show 4.

- Memory Functions:

1. M+ (Memory Add): Adds the current display value to memory.
   Example: If 5 is displayed, pressing M+ will add 5 to memory.
2. M- (Memory Subtract): Subtracts the current display value from memory.
   Example: If 3 is displayed and memory has 5, pressing M- will change memory to 2.
3. MR (Memory Recall): Displays the value stored in memory.
   Example: If memory is 2, pressing MR will display 2.
4. MC (Memory Clear): Resets memory to zero.

- Keyboard Shortcuts:

1. Numbers and operators can be entered directly using the keyboard.
2. Press Enter for "=", Backspace for "Clear", and the appropriate keys for operators like "+", "-", "\*", and "/".

- Error Handling:
  -> Division by Zero: Displays "Error" if a division by zero is attempted.
  Example: Entering 8 ÷ 0 will display "Error."

MOBILE-FRIENDLINESS:
This calculator is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. All functionalities remain accessible and easy to use on different screen sizes.

EXAMPLE USAGE:

1. Calculation with Memory:

Enter 10 + 5 and press "=", the display shows 15.
Press M+ to store 15 in memory.
Clear the screen, enter 3, and press M+ again, adding 3 to memory.
Press MR to recall the memory, which will now display 18.

2. Square Root:

Enter 9, press "√", and the display will show 3.

CONCLUSION:
This calculator provides a reliable, easy-to-use interface for performing basic calculations, complete with extra features like memory storage and square root functions. The code structure also ensures error handling and responsiveness for a smooth user experience.
